## Overview

The **Medicine Data Analysis Project** processes and analyzes pharmaceutical data to identify trends, patterns, and key insights that can aid healthcare professionals in optimizing medical prescriptions and drug usage. Using Python, this project performs **data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and visualization** to enhance the understanding of medicine-related datasets.

---

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Processing**: Handles missing values, normalizes fields, and prepares structured data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Extracts insights into medicine usage, demand trends, and pricing patterns.
- **Visualization & Insights**: Displays medicine trends through interactive charts and graphs.
- **Customizable Analysis**: Enables parameterized data exploration based on medicine categories, manufacturers, and pricing.

## Project Files

### 1. `medicine.csv`
This dataset contains structured pharmaceutical data with fields such as:
- **Medicine Name**: The name of the drug.
- **Category**: Type of medicine (e.g., Antibiotic, Painkiller, etc.).
- **Manufacturer**: Company producing the medicine.
- **Price**: Retail price of the medicine.
- **Stock Availability**: Quantity available.
- **Usage**: Description of medical usage.

### 2. `main.py`
This script loads and processes medicine data, performs analysis, and visualizes results.

#### Key Components:

- **Data Loading & Cleaning**:
  - Reads data from `medicine.csv`.
  - Handles missing values and incorrect data formats.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Summarizes medicine trends and pricing variations.
  - Generates statistical distributions and correlation analysis.

- **Data Visualization**:
  - Uses **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for graphical representation.
  - Displays pricing trends, category-wise distribution, and stock availability.

#### Example Code:
```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('medicine.csv')

# Data Cleaning
data.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)

# Visualizing medicine price distribution
sns.histplot(data['Price'], bins=20, kde=True)
plt.title('Medicine Price Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Price')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
```

## How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
Ensure required libraries are installed:
```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
```

### Step 2: Run the Script
Execute the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 3: View Insights
- Price variations across different medicines.
- Distribution of medicine categories and their manufacturers.
- Availability trends based on stock levels.

## Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning Models**: Implement predictive analytics for medicine demand forecasting.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Develop a web-based UI using Streamlit or Dash.
- **API Integration**: Connect with real-time pharmaceutical databases for live updates.
- **Automated Reporting**: Generate automated reports on medicine price trends and availability.
